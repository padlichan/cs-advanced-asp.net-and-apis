# Advanced Web API Project

This repository is a small project designed to practice creating simple web APIs with ASP.NET Core while learning more advanced concepts such as health checks, rate limiting, and caching.
The primary focus of this project is to implement a robust API that includes essential features like health monitoring, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and caching for improved performance.

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Implement and configure health checks to monitor the health and status of API endpoints.
- Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.
- Integrate output caching to optimize performance by reducing redundant processing and speeding up response times.
- Learn and practice best practices in API development using ASP.NET Core, focusing on advanced concepts and middleware configuration.
